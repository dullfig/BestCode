//! TUI event loop — merges input, pipeline, tick, and render events.
//!
//! Spawns a tokio task that multiplexes:
//! - crossterm keyboard/mouse events
//! - pipeline broadcast events
//! - tick interval (4Hz — refresh from kernel)
//! - render interval (30fps — draw frame)
//!
//! All events flow through a single mpsc channel as TuiMessages.
